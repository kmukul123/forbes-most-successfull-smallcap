fix: Persist edited company descriptions across navigation

- Modifies the `Data` service to store company data in memory, preventing loss of edits upon navigation.
- Implements an `updateCompanyData` method in the `Data` service to update specific company records in the in-memory store.
- Connects the `onSave` event from `DescriptionDisplay` to the `DescriptionPage` component, which then calls the `Data` service's update method.
