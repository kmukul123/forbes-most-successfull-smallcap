fix: Implement case-insensitive data parsing for company data

- Adds a `normalizeKeysToUppercase` helper function in `data.ts` to recursively convert all string keys in company data objects to uppercase.
- Applies this normalization during data fetching in `getAmericasData()` and `getAsiaData()` to ensure consistent key casing across the application.
- Resolves issues where company data (e.g., "Able Global" from Asia) was not displaying due to case-sensitivity mismatches between JSON and code.
