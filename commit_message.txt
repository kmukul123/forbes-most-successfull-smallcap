feat: Implement list-aware navigation and data persistence

- Introduces `listCode` to `ListData` interface and assigns it during data fetching in `Data` service.
- Modifies `Data` service to include `getCompanyByTickerAndList` and updates `updateCompanyData` to use `listCode` for targeted data operations.
- Updates `reusable-table.html` to pass `listCode` as a route parameter when navigating to the description page.
- Refactors `description-page.ts` to receive `listCode` from route parameters, fetch company data from the correct list, and ensure previous/next navigation and description saves are list-specific.
- Updates `app.routes.ts` to include `listCode` as a route parameter for the description page.
