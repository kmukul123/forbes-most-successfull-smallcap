refactor: Simplify data fetching in DescriptionPage component

- Introduces `getListData` method in `Data` service to centralize fetching of specific `ListData` objects based on `listCode`.
- Refactors `DescriptionPage` component to utilize `dataService.getListData()`, simplifying its `ngOnInit` method by removing redundant `if/else if` blocks for data fetching.
