feat: Localize swipe gestures to description page

- Removes global `HammerModule` configuration from `app.config.ts` to prevent unintended gesture recognition across the application.
- Adds `HammerModule` directly to the `DescriptionPage` component's imports, enabling swipe gestures only on that specific page.
- Ensures `hammerjs` is loaded only when and where it's needed, improving performance and preventing potential conflicts with other touch interactions.
